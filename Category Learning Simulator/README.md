# Category Learning Simulator

This repository contains code for my category learning simulator app. The app is designed to help category learning researchers determine, computationally, the performance that can be expected from a random responder.
The Shiny App has been deployed at https://anthonycruz.shinyapps.io/category-learning-sim/?_ga=2.21603835.1523995509.1646692810-1695429528.1646692810. 
The computations become more time-consuming with larger numbers of simulations, so I reommend starting with a small number of simulations.
